# Personal website

This is the source code for my [personal landing page](google.com) . I crafted this little project from scratch using React (TypeScript flavor) to showcase some of my recent work, thoughts, and a bit about who I am.

Feel free to look around!

## What's This Repo?

This repository contains the code for my personal landing page. It's straightforward, clean, and responsive. While this site might look simple, it incorporates modern web practices and some cool React features.

Since I believe in sharing and open-source, I've made the code public. Whether you're a beginner wanting to learn how itâ€™s built or an experienced developer looking for a template to kickstart your own site, you're welcome to use it as a base!

## Using This Repository As A Template

If you decide to use this code as a template for your website:
- **Please give proper attribution by linking back to this repo.** That's all I ask!
- Feel free to modify, tweak, and make it your own.

## Feedback

If you have suggestions or spot an issue, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm all for improving the code and learning from community feedback.

Thanks for checking out my project! ðŸŒŸ
